### Inspiration  
E-commerce has emerged to be one of the most growing industries of the past decade.But still many local sellers do not have the appropriate resources to enter this model.
We hence aim to build is a full stack E-Commerce Application where even local sellers can register their shops and products.All necessary features in an Ecommerce web application have been implemented in our platform. We have also integrated it with a product recommendation system to improve our user's experience.  

### Technical Features Implemented

2. CRUD operations on products, categories.
3. Viewing products sorted based on their categories.
4. Search engine to quickly retrieve the products needed.
5. Filtering mechanism to filter products based on price.
6. Adding reviews to any product.
7. Adding products to our wishlist.
8. Add/edit options for our cart.
